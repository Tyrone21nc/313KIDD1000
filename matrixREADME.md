##This is HW8, the matrix library is done in C++ and in C

##To compile my code just do the regular compilation commands for c++ and c files:

#For C++:
g++ -Wall matrix.cpp -o matrix1\n
#for C
gcc -Wall matrix.c -o matrix2\n

# For trying out different types of matrices, just alter it in the main.
#For C++:
1. change the value to your prefered matrix size (line 3(25-26) ):
   const int row = 3;
    const int col = 3;
